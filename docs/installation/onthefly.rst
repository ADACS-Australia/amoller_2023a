Using the on the fly classification
========================

After installing SuperNNova, you can use on the fly functionality.

The goal is to be able to input manually or load light-curve(s) from a file and classify them using a pre-trained model. This option does not build auxiliary files such as the database and is designed for small datasets.

Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the skeleton provided in ``run_onthefly.py`` to design your application.
