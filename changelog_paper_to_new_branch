March 2019
- added --sntype as dictionary input allowing different types of SNe (always put Its as first entry!)

February 2019
- option to specify raw_dir fits_dir which differs from dump_dir
- option to process data for testing or training only (no splits)
- hardcoded one-hot encoding to avoid differences between datasets created (implemented for DES only!)
- fits naming has changed DES_FITPOT.FITRES -> FITOPT.FITRES
- if testing dataset use normalization constants used in the trained model (--model_files)
- if testing dataset remove need for fits to be present (--model_files)
